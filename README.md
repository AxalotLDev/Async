**Async** is a Fabric mod designed to improve entity performance by processing them in parallel using multiple CPU cores and threads.


## Important❗
**Async** is currently in alpha testing and is experimental. Its use may lead to incorrect entity behavior and crashes.



### 💡 Key Benefits:
- ⚡ **Improved TPS**: Maintains stable tick times even with a large number of entities.
- 🚀 **Multithreading**: Utilizes multiple CPU cores for parallel entity processing.
- 🎲 **Async Random Ticks** (Experimental): Processes random ticks asynchronously for better performance.
