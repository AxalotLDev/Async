## So what is Async?
Async is a Fabric mod designed to improve entity processing performance. It does this by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. It is recommended to use with Lithium for best performance.

## So what is Async not?
Async is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.
Although it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.
So backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.
